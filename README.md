# MNIST Neural Network in C

This projects aims to create a flexible neural network implementation in C, that predicts the numbers depicted in handwritten images in the MNIST dataset.

There are a number of inspirations for this project, including:

AndrewCarterUK's [repo](https://github.com/AndrewCarterUK/mnist-neural-network-plain-c)

3 Blue 1 Brown's [YouTube series on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

Mark Kraay's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReOxVMxS83o) and [accompanying repo](https://github.com/markkraay/mnist-from-scratch)

CyberZHG's [repo on layer normalization](https://github.com/CyberZHG/torch-layer-normalization)

## Approach to this Neural Network

This project is a naive attempt at building a simple neural network and has a few 'shortcuts' taken, including a lack of GPU utilization.

I hope to update this repo as time goes on with adjustments to the error, activation, and training methods.

I have tried to make the underlying code as flexible as possible, allowing for quick adjustments to the number of layers, neurons, biases, etc. To see my convoluted implementation of a matrix library in C, check out [Matrix](https://github.com/andersensam/Matrix).

As you may expect, the models exported from this neural network cannot be used with any other existing framework that I'm aware of. I had fun coming up with a different file format based on the [Yann LeCun MNIST dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### A Note on EMNIST

The original MNIST dataset is relatively small and contains only digits. As the [EMNIST (Extended MNIST)](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset) dataset is available in the same binary format as the Yann LeCun MNIST dataset (linked above), we can simply point to the EMNIST datasets' labels and images to train / run inference on them.

If using the digits dataset, there are no changes needed; **however**, to add in letters, `include/MNIST_Labels.h` needs to be modified. The line here must be adjusted:

```
#define MNIST_LABELS 10
```

If using the EMIST balanced dataset, change to the following:

```
#define MNIST_LABELS 47
```

No other changes are required beyond the above.

## Compilation

This neural network implementation now uses CMake for builds. It is recommended to create a separate build directory and then run CMake there:

```
mkdir -v build
cd build && cmake ..
make
```

For building with debug symbols, use the following instead of `cmake ..`:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

## Using the Neural Network

The main binary has three options available (with suboptions for train and predict):

1. Train: train the model on a specified set of images and labels

2. Predict: run inference on a set of images and validate against labels

3. Help: show the help menu

### Training the Neural Network (online training)

As noted above, the first option is to train a new neural network from scratch. To get started, examine the following syntax:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network train <path to labels> <path to images> <learning rate> <use biases> <number of layers> <[neurons in each layer]> <images to train on> <epochs> <model name>
```

A complete example is listed below:
```
./build/mnist-neural-network train data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 0.1 true 3 784 100 10 1500 2 small_100.model
```

The example reveals that: we want to train a new model, using a **learning rate** of 0.1, we want to use biases, there are **3** total layers (including input). The first layer has 784 neurons, the second has 100, and the output has 10. We want to train on a subset of 1500 images and we want to export the model to file `small_100.model`.

Running the example above produces the following output:

```
$ ./build/mnist-neural-network train data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 0.1 true 3 784 100 10 1500 2 small_100.model

[2024-09-18 23:33:00]: Finished saving model
```

#### Retraining an existing Model (online)

In the event that you'd like to train and existing model with more data, use the following:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network update-online <path to labels> <path to images> <images to train on> <epochs> <existing model path> <updated model path>
```

An example is:
```
./build/mnist-neural-network update-online data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 20000 3 test.model updated.model
```

We import the existing model and its metadata, then train on 20000 images by three epochs, saving to `updated.model`

```
$ ./build/mnist-neural-network update-online data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 20000 3 test.model updated.model

[2024-10-12 12:20:03]: Starting to load MNIST images

[2024-10-12 12:20:10]: Saving updated model
[2024-10-12 12:20:10]: Finished saving updated model
```

*Note: retraining an existing model preserves the original learning rate*

### (Mini)batch Training of the Neural Network

Using (mini)batch, we can train the Neural Network with the following syntax:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network batch-train <path to labels> <path to images> <learning rate> <lambda> <use biases> <number of layers> <[neurons in each layer]> <images to train on> <batch size> <epochs> <model name>
```

A complete example is listed below:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network batch-train data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 0.1 0.0 false 3 784 100 10 10000 10 3 small_100_batch.model
```

In the example above, we use a **learning rate** of 0.1, we set **labmda** to 0 (no regularization for weight decay) we do not use any biases (all initialized to 0), we train on 10000 images, with a batch size of 10, and we run through the full dataset 3 times. We save the result to `small_100_batch.model`.

Running the above results in:

```
$ ./build/mnist-neural-network batch-train data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 0.1 0.0 false 3 784 100 10 10000 10 3 small_100_batch.model

[2024-09-25 21:03:38]: Starting to load MNIST labels
[2024-09-25 21:03:38]: Finished loading MNIST labels
[2024-09-25 21:03:38]: Starting to load MNIST images
[2024-09-25 21:03:39]: Finished loading MNIST images
[2024-09-25 21:03:39]: Starting model training
[2024-09-25 21:03:43]: Finished model training
[2024-09-25 21:03:43]: Saving model
[2024-09-25 21:03:43]: Finished saving model
```

As you can set the batch size to whatever you'd like, you could use the batch size as the total training image size for full batch training.

#### Retraining an existing Model (batch)

In the event that you'd like to train and existing model with more data with batching, use the following:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network update-batch <path to labels> <path to images> <images to train on> <batch size> <epochs> <existing model path> <updated model path>
```

An example is:
```
./build/mnist-neural-network update-batch data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 20000 8 3 test.model updated.model
```

We import the existing model and its metadata, then train on 20000 images by three epochs (with batch size 8), saving to `updated.model`

```
$ ./build/mnist-neural-network update-batch data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte data/train-images-idx3-ubyte 20000 8 3 test.model updated.model

[2024-10-12 12:20:55]: Starting to load MNIST images

[2024-10-12 12:21:01]: Saving updated model
[2024-10-12 12:21:01]: Finished saving updated model
```

*Note: retraining an existing model preserves the original learning rate and lambda*

#### Threaded (Mini)batch Training

(Mini)batch training can be sped up by using threading, with the following syntax:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network threaded-batch <path to labels> <path to images> <learning rate> <lambda> <use biases> <number of layers> <[neurons in each layer]> <images to train on> <batch size> <epochs> <model name>
```

An example is:
```
./exe/main threaded-batch data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte 0.05 0.0 true 3 784 100 47 10000 4 16 test.model
```

Here we train on 10000 images with a batch size of 4, iterating over 16 total epochs. Note that **important** tunables are available in `training.h` that control threading. For threaded training, we are particularly concerned with `TRAINING_MAX_THREADS` and `THREAD_EPOCHS_BEFORE_COMBINE`. While the maximum threads is fairly self explanatory, `THREAD_EPOCHS_BEFORE_COMBINE` requires a bit of explanation -- this value controls how many epochs are scheduled per thread before the weights and biases are averaged across the network.

If we have:
```
#define TRAINING_MAX_THREADS 2
#define THREAD_EPOCHS_BEFORE_COMBINE 2
```

We expect that for each of the two threads, we will run through two whole epochs before averaging the weights and biases. This forces us value of `epochs` passed to the command line to be **>= `TRAINING_MAX_THREADS` * `THREAD_EPOCHS_BEFORE_COMBINE`**. In our example, the minimum number of epochs is 4.

Keep in mind that `epochs` on the command line refers to the **total** number of epochs scheduled across all threads, so in our example with 16, we will average out the weights and biases a total of 4 times (16 / (2 * 2)).

With our test command above, we receive the following output:
```
$ ./exe/main threaded-batch data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte 0.05 0.0 true 3 784 100 47 10000 4 16 test.model

```

### Running Inference

Running inference on a trained model follows a similar syntax:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network predict <path to labels> <path to images> <images to predict> <path to model>
```

An example is:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network predict data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte 1000 models/large_100.model
```

Executing the above results in:

```
$ /target/main predict data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte 1000 models/large_100.model

[2024-09-18 23:39:04]: Starting to load MNIST labels

Statistics:
Model path: models/large_100.model
Images predicted: 1000
Images predicted correctly: 946
Percentage correct: 94.60000%
```

### Multithreaded Inference

Running multithreaded inference is the same as standard inference, only swapping out `predict` for `threaded-predict`:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network threaded-predict <path to labels> <path to images> <images to predict> <path to model>
```

An example is:

```
./build/mnist-neural-network threaded-predict data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte 1000 models/large_256_32.model
```

Executing the above results in:
```
$ ./build/mnist-neural-network threaded-predict data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte 1000 models/large_256_32.model

Images predicted: 10000
Images predicted correctly: 9228
Percentage correct: 92.28000%
```

**Note:** To adjust the number of threads used in `threaded-predict`, please adjust `INFERENCE_MAX_THREADS` in `inference.h`. Its default value is 4.
